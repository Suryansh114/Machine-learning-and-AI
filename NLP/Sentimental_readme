In this project, I'll be explaining the code for "sentimental_code", which performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews.
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews. Each entry in the dataset represents a sentence or a part of a sentence, along with a sentiment label ranging from 0 to 4:
0 – Negative
1 – Somewhat Negative
2 – Neutral
3 – Somewhat Positive
4 – Positive
These labels reflect the emotional tone of each review snippet, indicating how people have responded to a movie.
Our objective is to predict the sentiment for unseen (test) data where the sentiment labels are not provided. Essentially, this is a multi-class classification problem in machine learning. However, selecting the right model is crucial for achieving good performance.

To gain a better understanding of the dataset, we began with exploratory data analysis, visualizing various distributions and patterns within the data to inform our modeling approach.
