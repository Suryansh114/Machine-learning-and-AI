1. E rror at Output Layer (Layer 2)
    We want to compute:
    ∂L/∂W2,∂L/∂b2 

    Assume the loss function is Mean Squared Error:
    L=1/[2(y−y^)2]=1/[2(y−A2)2L] 

    Now compute the derivative of loss with respect to the activation:
    δ2=∂L/∂A2⋅∂A2/∂Z2=(A2−y)⋅σ′(Z2)\delta_2 

    This δ2\delta_2δ2 is the error at the output layer.
